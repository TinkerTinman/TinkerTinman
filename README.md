Hello,

I'm Ryan Tiner and I like to tinker, you will notice most of my respoitories are collections of small bits of code that I found to help myself learn faster and have fun while doing it. 

I've always appreciated simple things that could be turned into larger things quickly and even more so using things in way they might not have been the orginal design, but works just as well.  

That's why when I get in the mood I like to play around with PowerShell, it's on every work computer and can do more than people think.

Feel free to reach out to me here or at my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-tiner/
